# Falsifiability of WIDE  
*All Conditions Under Which the Wake-Inferred Dark Energy Framework Fails*

A scientific theory must be falsifiable.  
WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) is intentionally designed with **clear, sharp, and testable failure modes** arising from its physical assumptions:

- General Relativity is exact.  
- Dark energy is a minimally coupled, canonical scalar field.  
- w(a) > –1 at all times (non-phantom).  
- Thawing dynamics: w(a) increases from –1 at late times.  
- Potential is smooth, shallow, and slowly varying.  

If observations violate any of these assumptions, WIDE fails.

This document enumerates all ways WIDE can be tested—and broken—by data.

---

# 1. Falsification by Equation-of-State Behavior

### **1.1 Phantom Crossing (w < –1)**  
If data require:

```
w(a) < -1
```

at any redshift, WIDE is falsified immediately.

Reason:
- canonical scalar fields enforce φ̇² ≥ 0 → w > –1.

### **1.2 Freezing Behavior (dw/d ln a < 0)**  
If the equation of state becomes *more* negative with time, WIDE is falsified.

Freezing models evolve toward w = –1 from above, while WIDE requires thawing (w starts at –1 and rises).

### **1.3 Rapid Evolution or Sharp Features in w(a)**  
Any strong oscillation or discontinuity violates the smooth thawing conditions.

---

# 2. Falsification by Expansion History H(z)

Given w(a), WIDE predicts H(a) uniquely.

WIDE fails if:

### **2.1 H(z) implies negative or singular ρ_φ(a)**  
From:

```
ρ_φ(a) = (3/κ) H²(a) - ρ_m(a) - ρ_r(a)
```

If ρ_φ(a) < 0 for any redshift → impossible for scalar fields.

### **2.2 Expansion rate contradicts thawing constraints**  
For example:
- H(z) falls too quickly (freezing-like behavior),
- or rises too sharply (phantom-like behavior).

### **2.3 Inconsistent curvature of H(z)**  
If data require curvature incompatible with smooth, shallow potentials.

---

# 3. Falsification by Growth of Structure

This is the strongest test of WIDE.  
In GR, H(z) determines growth uniquely.

### **3.1 Growth too suppressed**  
If observed fσ₈(z) is **more** suppressed than any GR-scalar-field model allows.

Typical threshold:

```
Δ fσ₈(z) < -8%   (in the Growth Focus Window)
```

### **3.2 Growth too enhanced**  
Canonical scalar fields cannot enhance growth relative to ΛCDM.

If:

```
Δ fσ₈(z) > 0
```

in a statistically significant way → WIDE is falsified.

### **3.3 Non-monotonic growth signatures**  
Growth curves with oscillatory features signal modified gravity or noncanonical fields.

### **3.4 Failure of the GR consistency function**

```
G_GR(a) = 0   (must hold in GR)
```

If observed data imply:

```
|G_GR(a)| > observational uncertainty
```

→ WIDE fails.

# 4. Falsification by Potential Reconstruction

The reconstructed potential V(φ) must satisfy thawing conditions:

### **4.1 V′ too steep**  
If:

```
|V′/V|  >  O(1) / M_pl
```

WIDE cannot produce the observed w(a).

### **4.2 V″ too large**  
If curvature is excessive:

```
|V′′| >> H²
```

This violates smoothness and thawing behavior.

### **4.3 Non-smooth or oscillatory V(φ)**  
Any reconstruction producing sharp features invalidates WIDE.

### **4.4 Negative potential**  
If V(φ) < 0 over the reconstruction domain → incompatible with thawing.

---

# 5. Falsification by Field Behavior φ(a)

From the kinetic fraction:

```
φ′² = 3 Ω_φ(a) (1 + w(a)) M_pl²
```

WIDE fails if:

### **5.1 Field displacement too large**  
Thawing requires:

```
|Δφ|  <<  M_pl
```

Excessive displacement signals non-thawing or noncanonical evolution.

### **5.2 φ′ < 0 (reverse rolling)**  
Scalar fields cannot spontaneously reverse direction without fine-tuned features.

### **5.3 φ acceleration inconsistent with thawing**  
If:

```
φ̈ + 3H φ̇ + V′(φ) = 0
```

cannot be satisfied with V′ smooth and shallow.

---

# 6. Falsification by Multi-Probe Inconsistency

WIDE requires all cosmological probes to agree:

- H(z)  
- D_L(z)  
- D_A(z)  
- fσ₈(z)  
- weak lensing  
- CMB distance priors  

The framework is falsified if:

### **6.1 Expansion and growth cannot be matched simultaneously**  
This is the most common failure mode for non-GR or non-scalar-field physics.

### **6.2 Distance data require sharp w(a) features**  
Impossible for thawing fields.

### **6.3 Weak-lensing amplitude contradicts predicted growth**  
WIDE cannot adjust growth independently of H(z).

### **Equation-of-state failures:**
- Phantom behavior (w < –1)

# 8. Conclusion

WIDE is a **highly constrained**, **strongly falsifiable** framework.  
It has:
- no modified gravity freedom,  
- no phantom freedom,  
- no exotic kinetic terms,  
- and no arbitrary potential shapes.

This makes it scientifically robust:  
**WIDE is easy to break — and that’s a strength.**

If the Universe behaves in a way incompatible with any one of the conditions above,  
the WIDE framework immediately fails and must be replaced or extended.

# Growth Signatures in WIDE  
*Predictions for Structure Formation and fσ₈(z)*

Growth of cosmic structure is one of the most powerful tests of dark-energy physics.  
Unlike expansion measurements—which can be matched by many models—the **growth history fσ₈(z)** is tightly constrained by GR and the physics of the scalar field.

WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) predicts a specific, distinctive pattern of growth behavior arising from thawing scalar-field dynamics.

This document explains those predictions, their physical origins, and how they differ from ΛCDM.

Referenced equations (E#) appear in `/equations/equations.md`.

# 1. Why Growth is Crucial for WIDE

In GR, with a minimally coupled scalar field:
- the expansion history H(z),
- the matter density Ω_m(a),
- and the growth rate f(a)

are **not independent**.

Given H(z), GR uniquely predicts f(a).  
Thus:

> **If observed growth does not match the GR-predicted growth from H(z), WIDE is falsified.**

This makes growth the strongest falsification lever in the entire framework.

# 2. The Growth Equation

The linear matter overdensity δ satisfies:

(E39) —  
```
δ'' + [2 + (Ḣ/H²)] δ' - (3/2) Ω_m(a) δ = 0
```

Define:

(E40) —  
```
f(a) = d ln δ / d ln a
```

and the observable:

(E41) —  
```
fσ₈(a) = f(a) * σ₈(a)
```

Because H(a) is determined by ρ_φ(a), which is determined by w(a), which is reconstructed from data, WIDE predicts fσ₈(a) with no free parameters once w(a) is known.

# 3. How Thawing Dynamics Modify Growth

Thawing models:
- start with w ≈ –1,
- develop slight kinetic energy at late times,
- produce slightly larger H(z),
- and thus suppress growth mildly.

Key behaviors:

### **1. Growth is nearly identical to ΛCDM at high redshift**
Since w ≈ –1 and dark energy is negligible, growth matches ΛCDM.

### **2. Growth becomes suppressed at low redshift**
Slightly increased H(z) reduces the matter source term in the growth equation.

### **3. The maximum difference occurs at intermediate redshifts**
Typically in the range 0.3 < z < 1.2, the **Growth Focus Window**.

This is where WIDE’s predictions differ most from ΛCDM.

# 4. Quantitative Growth Predictions

For realistic thawing models:

(E51) —  
```
Δ fσ₈(z) ≡ fσ₈_WIDE(z) - fσ₈_ΛCDM(z)
```

WIDE predicts:

### **High redshift (z > 2)**  
```
Δ fσ₈ ≈ 0
```

### **Intermediate redshift (0.3 < z < 1.2)**  
```
Δ fσ₈ ≈ -2% to -6%
```

### **Low redshift (z < 0.3)**  
```
Δ fσ₈ ≈ -1% to -3%
```

The suppression is:
- smooth,
- monotonic,
- and directly linked to w(a).

These ranges depend on w₀ and wₐ but remain small for thawing models.

# 5. Distinguishing Thawing Models from ΛCDM

### **Signature 1 — Mild, smooth suppression**
WIDE predicts consistent, modest growth suppression without sharp features.

### **Signature 2 — Maximum suppression in the Growth Focus Window**
The shape of Δfσ₈(z) peaks around z ~ 0.7.

### **Signature 3 — Correlation with H(z)**
More negative w(a) → closer to ΛCDM.  
Less negative w(a) → slightly stronger suppression.

### **Signature 4 — No phantom-induced enhancements**
Because WIDE forbids w < –1, it forbids:
- enhanced growth, or
- oscillatory growth signatures.

---

# 6. Sensitivity to w(a)

Growth is highly sensitive to:
- the combination (1 + w),
- the slope dw/d ln(a),
- and the timing of thawing.

### **Early thawing**  
More growth suppression.

### **Late thawing**  
Less suppression.

### **Stronger kinetic fraction**  
More suppression → but constrained by data to remain small.

This sensitivity makes growth a powerful discriminator between potentials in V(φ)-space.

---

# 7. Consistency with GR Predictions

Given H(z), GR predicts fσ₈(z) uniquely via the growth equation.  
Thus:

(E43) — GR Consistency Function  
```
G_GR(a) ≡ f' + f² + [2 + (Ḣ/H²)] f - (3/2) Ω_m(a)
```

For any viable scalar-field model:

(E44) —  
```
G_GR(a) = 0
```

If observations imply:

```
|G_GR(a)| > σ_obs
```

then **WIDE is falsified**.

This makes growth data essential for model validation.

# 8. Key Observable Predictions

WIDE predicts:

### ✔ Slightly suppressed growth relative to ΛCDM  
(typically 2–6%)

### ✔ No sharp features or turning points in growth curves  
(smooth thawing behavior)

### ✔ Growth suppression that correlates with w(a)  
(different from modified gravity)

### ✔ A specific shape of suppression in the Growth Focus Window  
(peak suppression at intermediate redshift)

### ✔ GR-consistent growth  
(no deviation beyond scalar-field physics)

# 9. Comparison With Modified Gravity

Modified gravity often produces:
- larger deviations from ΛCDM,
- scale-dependent growth,
- enhanced growth rates,
- or inconsistent expansion–growth relationships.

In contrast, WIDE:
- has scale-independent predictions,
- links growth directly to expansion,
- cannot produce enhanced growth,
- cannot produce strong deviations.

Thus:
- **small deviations → thawing scalar fields**,  
- **large or inconsistent deviations → modified gravity**.

# 10. Summary

WIDE predicts:

- ΛCDM-like growth at high z,  
- smooth, modest suppression at late times,  
- peak differences in the Growth Focus Window,  
- GR-consistent evolution,  
- and no phantom or oscillatory behavior.

Growth measurements, especially fσ₈(z), form one of the most powerful tools for:
- constraining w(a),
- constraining V(φ),
- testing GR,
- and falsifying the WIDE framework.

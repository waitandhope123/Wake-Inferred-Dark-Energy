# WIDE Glossary  
*Key Terms and Concepts Used Throughout the Framework*

This glossary defines all major cosmological and theoretical terms appearing in the WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) framework. It also standardizes symbols and vocabulary across the repository.

---

# A

### **Acceleration (cosmic)**
The observed late-time speeding-up of the Universe’s expansion, inferred from Type Ia supernovae and confirmed by BAO, CMB, and large-scale structure.

### **Action (scalar-field)**
The integral that defines the dynamics of a scalar field φ in General Relativity. Used to derive field equations.  
See `/derivations/field_equations.md`.

---

# B

### **BAO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations)**
Periodic clustering pattern of galaxies originating from sound waves in the early Universe. A standard ruler for measuring distances and H(z).

### **Background cosmology**
The homogeneous expansion described by the Friedmann equations and characterized by H(a) or H(z).

---

# C

### **Canonical scalar field**
A scalar field with standard kinetic term (½ ∂φ²) and minimal coupling to gravity. WIDE assumes this form for dark energy.

### **CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background)**
Relic radiation from the early Universe. Provides key constraints on expansion history, geometry, and matter density.

### **Continuity equation**
The conservation equation linking w(a), energy density evolution, and expansion.  
Used in reconstructing w(a) from H(z).

---

# D

### **Dark energy**
The component responsible for accelerating expansion. In WIDE, dark energy is modeled as a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field with thawing dynamics.

### **DESI**
Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument — provides high-precision BAO and RSD measurements crucial for WIDE.

### **Distances (cosmological)**
Includes luminosity distance, angular diameter distance, and comoving distance. Determined by H(z).

---

# E

### **Equation of state w(a)**
Ratio of pressure to energy density for dark energy. Determines the kinetic/potential split of the scalar field.

### **Expansion history H(z)**
The redshift-dependent Hubble parameter that describes the Universe’s rate of expansion. One of the primary inputs to WIDE.

---

# F

### **Falsifiability**
The property that WIDE can be proven wrong if observational conditions violate its assumptions (e.g., w < –1 or GR inconsistency).

### **fσ₈(z)**
Combination of the growth rate of structure (f) and matter clustering amplitude (σ₈). A major diagnostic in the Growth Focus Window.

---

# G

### **GR (General Relativity)**
Einstein’s theory of gravity. WIDE operates fully within GR; no modifications or extra degrees of freedom are introduced.

### **Growth of structure**
The buildup of cosmic matter fluctuations over time. Sensitive to both the expansion history and the physics of dark energy.

### **Growth Focus Window (GFW)**
The redshift interval 0.3 < z < 1.2 where growth measurements most effectively constrain thawing dark energy.  
See `/predictions/growth_focus_window.md`.

---

# H

### **H(z)**
Hubble parameter as a function of redshift. Determines the expansion rate and is reconstructed from BAO, SNe, and other datasets.

---

# K

### **Kinetic fraction**
The ratio (1 + w(a)), representing the scalar field’s kinetic energy relative to total dark-energy density.

---

# L

### **ΛCDM**
Lambda Cold Dark Matter — the standard cosmological model with constant dark energy (Λ) and cold dark matter. A special case of WIDE where φ is constant.

---

# M

### **Minimal coupling**
The scalar field interacts with gravity only through the metric, not via additional functions or couplings.

---

# O

### **Observational wake**
The full pattern of consequences left by dark energy across expansion, growth, and lensing data. Central concept in WIDE.

---

# P

### **Potential V(φ)**
The scalar-field potential that defines dark-energy microphysics. WIDE reconstructs V(φ) from data.

### **Phantom energy**
Dark energy with w < –1. Forbidden in WIDE due to ghost instabilities.

---

# R

### **Reconstruction**
The process of inferring w(a), φ(a), and V(φ) from data. Core method in WIDE.

### **RSD (Redshift-Space Distortions)**
Anisotropies in galaxy clustering due to peculiar velocities. Used to measure structure growth fσ₈(z).

---

# S

### **Scalar field φ**
A single dynamical field driving dark-energy evolution in WIDE.

### **SNe Ia (Type Ia Supernovae)**
Standardizable candles used to map distance–redshift relations.

### **σ₈**
Amplitude of matter fluctuations on 8 Mpc/h scales.

---

# T

### **Thawing model**
A scalar-field model where the field starts frozen at w ≈ –1 and gradually evolves toward less negative w at late times.

### **Time-variation of constants**
Laboratory and astrophysical tests that constrain scalar-field coupling. WIDE assumes no coupling (minimal).

---

# V

### **V(φ) reconstruction**
Mapping energy density and w(a) to the scalar potential. Described in detail in `/derivations/potential_reconstruction.md`.

---

# W

### **w(a)**
Dark-energy equation of state as a function of scale factor. Drives both expansion and growth.

### **Wake inference**
The process of reconstructing dark-energy microphysics from its cosmological wake (expansion, growth, lensing, CMB constraints).

---

# Z

### **Redshift z**
A measure of cosmic expansion. Many WIDE predictions and reconstructions are expressed as functions of z.

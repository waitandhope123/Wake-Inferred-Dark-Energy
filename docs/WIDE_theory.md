# WIDE Theory Overview

*Initialization placeholder.*

This document will contain the full conceptual and structural description of the WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) framework.

It will summarize:
- the underlying physical assumptions,
- the scalar-field model within standard General Relativity,
- thawing dynamics and late-time evolution,
- and the concept of reconstructing dark energy from its observational wake.

Detailed content will be added after the full repository skeleton is established.

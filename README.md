# WIDE — Wake-Inferred Dark Energy  
*A Data-Shaped Framework for Reconstructing Dark Energy Microphysics*

WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) is a cosmological framework designed to determine the **microphysical nature of dark energy** directly from its *full observational wake*: the combined imprint it leaves on cosmic expansion, structure growth, and gravitational consistency tests.

Unlike traditional approaches that assume a specific potential or modify gravity, **WIDE makes no prior guess** about the form of dark energy.  
Instead, it reconstructs the allowed space of models strictly from **observations**.

# 🚀 What WIDE Is

WIDE is a **reverse-inference framework**:

```text
data → H(z), distances, growth → w(a) → ϕ(a) → V(ϕ)
```

### More specifically, WIDE is:
- A **GR-consistent** framework  
- A **non-phantom, minimally coupled, canonical scalar field**  
- A **thawing** dark-energy class (slowly evolving away from w = –1)  
- A **data-shaped family of potentials**, not a fixed model  
- A method to **reconstruct microphysics** from observational consequences (“wake inference”)

WIDE models dark energy without changing gravity and without introducing exotic physics.

# 🔍 Why WIDE?

Modern cosmology has:
- extremely precise **expansion** data (BAO, SNe, CMB),
- weaker but improving **growth** data (fσ₈, weak lensing),
- and mounting hints that **dynamics may be present** at late times.

But typical studies either:
- **assume** a potential (e.g., exponential, power-law), or  
- choose **abstract parametrizations** (e.g., w₀–wₐ) with no microphysical meaning.

WIDE takes a different approach:

> **Let the Universe tell us what dark energy is — do not guess the potential; infer it from the wake.**

# 🧠 Core Principles

WIDE is built on six scientific pillars:

### 1. **General Relativity is correct**
No modified gravity.  
No extra degrees of freedom in the metric.

### 2. **Dark energy is a minimally coupled scalar field**
Canonical kinetic term, smooth potential.

### 3. **Thawing dynamics**
The field was frozen (w ≈ –1) and began rolling slowly at late times.

### 4. **Non-phantom behavior**
\( w(a) > -1 \) always.

### 5. **Observational wake inference**
The Universe’s behavior — expansion, distances, growth, lensing — defines the allowed field evolution.

### 6. **Falsifiability**
WIDE has sharp failure modes:
- If GR’s growth–expansion consistency fails → WIDE fails.  
- If data require phantom behavior → WIDE fails.  
- If freezing models are strongly preferred → WIDE is ruled out.

# 📊 What WIDE Produces

WIDE reconstructs:
- The **dark-energy equation of state** \( w(a) \)  
- The **scalar-field trajectory** \( \phi(a) \)  
- The **allowed potential family** \( V(\phi) \)  
- GR-based **growth predictions** (fσ₈(z))  
- **Expansion history** \( H(z) \)  
- **Future fate** of the Universe  
- Observable **signatures that distinguish WIDE from ΛCDM**

The framework is fully data-driven and improves as new data arrive.

# 🧩 Project Status

WIDE is in **phase 1: theoretical and documentation foundation.**

Planned next phases:
1. Add numerical reconstruction code.  
2. Hook into public datasets (DESI, SNe, lensing).  
3. Generate field trajectories and potential families.  
4. Produce full forecasts and plots.

The goal is a **complete, open, modular** dark-energy inference toolkit.

# 🌌 Final Note

**WIDE is an attempt to rethink dark-energy inference from the ground up.**  
It does not assume the answer.  
It extracts the answer from the Universe’s wake.

This repository will expand into a full, data-driven cosmology framework.

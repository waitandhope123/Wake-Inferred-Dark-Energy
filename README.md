# WIDE — Wake-Inferred Dark Energy

WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) is a cosmological framework designed to reconstruct the microphysical nature of dark energy directly from its full observational wake — the combined imprint it leaves on cosmic expansion, structure growth, and gravitational consistency tests.

WIDE assumes:
- standard General Relativity (no modified gravity),
- a minimally coupled, canonical scalar field,
- thawing dark-energy dynamics with \( w > -1 \),
- and no assumed potential form.

Instead of guessing a model, WIDE uses observational data to constrain:
- the dark-energy equation of state,
- scalar-field evolution \( \phi(a) \),
- and the allowed space of potentials \( V(\phi) \).

This repository will contain:
- conceptual and theory documentation (`/docs/`),
- full mathematical derivations (`/derivations/`),
- observational predictions (`/predictions/`),
- a centralized equation library (`/equations/`),
- and future numerical tools (`/code/`).

This file is a placeholder; full content will be added as the framework is built out.

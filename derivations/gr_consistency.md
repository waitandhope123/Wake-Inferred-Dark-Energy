# GR Consistency Conditions in WIDE  
*Expansion–Growth Relations Required by General Relativity*

WIDE (Wake-Inferred Dark Energy) is built entirely inside **General Relativity (GR)**.  
This gives the framework strong predictive power but also strong **falsifiability**.

If the Universe violates the GR-consistent relationships between:
- the expansion rate H(a),
- the matter density Ω_m(a),
- the scalar-field dynamics,
- and the structure-growth function fσ₈(a),

then **WIDE cannot fit the data**, and dark energy cannot be a minimally coupled canonical scalar field.

This document lays out those consistency conditions in full.

# 1. Why GR Consistency Matters

Because WIDE assumes:
- GR is correct,
- the field is minimally coupled,
- the field is canonical and non-phantom,

expansion and growth are linked by exact equations.

In modified gravity:
- expansion can be tuned to mimic ΛCDM,
- but growth changes independently.

WIDE cannot reproduce such behavior.  
This makes GR-consistency tests **central** to WIDE’s inference method.

# 2. Growth of Structure in GR

Linear matter perturbations δ(a) satisfy:

(E39) — Growth Equation  
```
δ'' + [2 + (Ḣ/H²)] δ' - (3/2) Ω_m(a) δ = 0
```

where primes denote derivatives with respect to ln(a).

The observable growth rate is defined as:

(E40) —  
```
f(a) = d ln δ / d ln a
```

The observable combination is:

(E41) —  
```
fσ₈(a) = f(a) * σ₈(a)
```

The growth function depends **only** on:
- H(a),
- Ω_m(a),
- and GR.

No information about the scalar field appears directly.

Thus the scalar field influences growth *only* through H(a).

---

# 3. GR Growth–Expansion Consistency

Given H(a), GR predicts a specific fσ₈(a).  
If observations provide a significantly different fσ₈(a), then:

- GR is violated,  
- or dark energy is not a canonical scalar field,  
- or non-minimal coupling exists.

WIDE cannot reproduce such deviations.

This is the key falsification test of the theory.

---

# 4. Consistency Condition Derivation

Start from the growth equation:

(E39)  

Rewrite in terms of f(a):

(E42) —  
```
f' + f² + [2 + (Ḣ/H²)] f = (3/2) Ω_m(a)
```

This differential equation fully determines f(a) once H(a) is known.

Thus:

> **In GR, growth is not an independent probe.**  
> It is constrained by the expansion history.

This allows WIDE to use fσ₈(a) as a *consistency check*.

---

# 5. Connecting H(a) to the Scalar Field

The expansion is determined by:

(E7) —  
```
H²(a) = (κ/3)[ρ_m(a) + ρ_r(a) + ρ_φ(a)]
```

where ρ_φ(a) is determined by w(a).

Thus, given w(a), WIDE predicts:
- φ(a),
- V(a),
- and H(a),

leading directly to a predicted fσ₈(a) via the growth equation.

No extra degrees of freedom are available to tune growth.

---

# 6. The GR Consistency Function

Define the GR consistency quantity:

(E43) —  
```
G_GR(a) ≡ f' + f² + [2 + (Ḣ/H²)] f - (3/2) Ω_m(a)
```

For any GR scalar-field model:

(E44) —  
```
G_GR(a) = 0
```

Deviations from zero indicate:
- modified gravity,
- non-minimal coupling,
- or systematic errors in data.

If:

```
|G_GR(a)| > observational uncertainty
```

then **WIDE is invalid**.

---

# 7. Implications for Thawing Models

Thawing models produce:
- slightly slower growth than ΛCDM,
- due to slightly faster late-time expansion,
- but not dramatically slower.

Thus they obey:

(E45) —  
```
Δ fσ₈(a) ≈ few percent below ΛCDM
```

If growth is suppressed by more than ~5–10% in the Growth Focus Window,  
a canonical scalar field cannot explain the data.

---

# 8. The Growth Focus Window (GFW)

WIDE is most sensitive to GR-consistency failures in:

(E46) —  
```
0.3 < z < 1.2
```

This is where:
- dark-energy fraction is large enough to influence growth,
- but matter still dominates dynamics,
- and thawing models diverge most from ΛCDM.

A violation here rules WIDE out strongly.

---

# 9. Falsification Scenarios

WIDE fails if:

### **Case 1 — Phantom-like behavior**
w(a) < –1 is impossible for canonical fields.  
If data require it, WIDE is false.

### **Case 2 — Growth too low**
If fσ₈(a) is significantly below GR predictions given H(a) → modified gravity.

### **Case 3 — Growth too high**
If growth exceeds GR predictions → requires extra clustering power, incompatible with scalar fields.

### **Case 4 — Freezing behavior**
If dw/d ln(a) < 0 → freezing, not thawing → outside WIDE’s domain.

# 10. Summary of GR Consistency Logic

WIDE enforces the following:

1. **Expansion H(a) determines growth** via GR.  
2. **w(a)** from H(a) determines ρ_φ(a), φ(a), and V(φ).  
3. With H(a) known, GR **predicts** fσ₈(a).  
4. Observed fσ₈(a) must match the GR prediction.  
5. If not, **WIDE is falsified**.

This consistency condition is one of the most important structural elements of the WIDE framework.
